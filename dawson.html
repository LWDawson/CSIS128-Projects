<h1><strong>Leon Dawson</strong></h1>
<p>You will find that once you get to be my age your hobbies and activities will become less about you and more about your family and taking care of the house,
yard, and your vehicles, etc.  This takes up most of my time when I am not at work.  This is assuming that you are not single without any children by the time 
you are forty-seven years old.  When I do have time to do what I want, I like to watch sports, read science fiction, fantasy, suspense/thrillers, or any 
combination of these genres, and I enjoy to drink a good Pinot Noir.
