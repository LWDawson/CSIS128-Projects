The current band members that play live are: <br> Joe Satriani- Guitar <br> Marco Minnemann- Drums <br> Bryan Beller- Bass <br> Mike Keneally- Keyboards, Guitar
<p>Some of his CD's include:</p> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Surfing with the Alien</strong><br>
<p>This is his 3rd CD released in 1987, it is also the CD which gave him commerical airplay and recognition as a instrumental rock guitarist.<br> It will always have a special meaning to me because I had never heard anything like it before.</p></li>
<li><strong>Flying in a Blue Dream</strong><br>
<p>This is his 5th CD released in 1989, this CD was his first and only CD which included songs that he wrote lyrics and sang.</p></li>

<p>This is his 15th CD released in 2002, although I like all 34 of his CD's, in my opinion this CD is one of his best from beginning to end.</p></li>
